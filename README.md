Whooo! Code! YEAH!

I was bored, so I "made" a website, based off of a [bootstrap template](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/) (that was free). I haven't figured out how to link the .tk domain to github yet, but until then you can preview the site by downloading the code and running the html file. What do you guys think?
